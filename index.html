    <p>Mic Check</p>
    <p>When I was led to you</p>
    <p>I knew you were the one for me</p>
    <p>Come through, dig the sound</p>
    <p>I swear the whole world could feel you MC</p>
    <p>Crowd around

    <p>I used to cop a lot, but never copped no drop</p>
    <p>Hold mics like pony tails tight and bob a lot</p>
    <p>Stop and stick around, come through and dig the sound</p>
    <p>Of the fly brown 6' 0" sicko psycho who throws his dick around</p>
    <p>Bound to go three-plat, came to destroy rap</p>
    <p>It's a intricate plot of a b-boy strapped</p>
    <p>Femstat cats get kidnapped</p>
    <p>Then release a statement to the press, let the rest know who did that</p>
    <p>Metal Fist terrorists claim responsibility</p>
    <p>Broken household name usually said in hostility</p>
    <p>Um... what is MF? You silly</p>
    <p>I'd like to take "Mens to the End" for two milli'</p>
    <p>"Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo!" That's a audio daily double</p>
    <p>Rappers need to fall off just to save me the trouble, yo</p>
    <p>Watch your own back came in and go out alone, black</p>
    <p>Stay in the zone—turn H2O to Cognac</p>

    <p>On Doomsday, ever since the womb</p>
    <p>'Til I'm back where my brother went, that's what my tomb will say</p>
    <p>Right above my government; Dumile</p>
    <p>Either unmarked or engraved, hey, who's to say?</p>

<section>
    <p>I wrote this one in B.C. D.C. O-section</p>
    <p>If you don't believe me, go get bagged and check then</p>
    <p>Cell number seventeen, up under the top bunk</p>
    <p>I say this not to be mean, wish bad luck or pop junk</p>
    <p>Pop the trunk on Cee Cipher Punk, leave him left scraped</p>
    <p>God forbid, if there ain't no escape, blame MF tape</p>
    <p>Definition "super-villain": a killer who love children</p>
    <p>One who is well-skilled in destruction, as well as building</p>
    <p>While Sidney Sheldon teaches the trife to be trifer</p>
    <p>I'm trading science fiction with my man the live lifer</p>
    <p>A pied piper holler a rhyme, a dollar and a dime</p>
    <p>Do his thing, ring around the white collar crime</p>
    <p>Get out my face, askin' ‘bout my case, need toothpaste</p>
    <p>Fresher mint, monkey-style nigga get mentadent</p>
    <p>And dope fiends still in they teens, shook niggas turn witness</p>
    <p>Real mens mind their own business</p>
    <p>That's the difference between sissy-pissy rappers that's double-dutch</p>
    <p>How come I hold the microphone double-clutch</p>
    <p>C.O.'s make rounds, never have ‘ox found</p>
    <p>On shakedown, lock-down, wet dreams of Fox' Brown</p>

<section>
  <p>Doomsday, ever since the womb</p>
  <p>‘Til I'm back to the essence, read it off the tomb</p>
  <p>Either engraved or unmarked grave, who's to say?</p>
  <p>Pass the mic like "Pass the peas like they used to say"</p>
  <p>Some M-er F-ers don't like how Sally walk</p>
  <p>I'll tell y'all fools it's hella cool how ladies from Cali talk</p>
  <p>Never let her interfere with the Yeti ghetto slang</p>
  <p>Nicknames off nipplin' tip of nipples metal fang</p>
  <p>Known amongst hoes for the bang-bang</p>
  <p>Known amongst foes for flow without no talking orangutans</p>
  <p>Only gin and Tang</p>
  <p>Guzzled out a rusty tin can, me and this mic is like yin and yang</p>
  <p>Clang! Crime don't pay, listen, youth</p>
  <p>It's like me holding up the line at the kissing booth</p>
  <p>I took her back to the truck, she was uncouth</p>
  <p>Spittin' all out the sunroof, through her missing tooth</p>
  <p>But then she has a sexy voice, sound like Jazzy Joyce</p>
  <p>So I turned it up faster than a speeding knife</p>
  <p>Strong enough to please a wife</p>
  <p>Able to drop today's math in the 48 keys of life</p>
  <p>Cut the crap far as rap</p>
  <p>Touch the mic, get the same thing a Arab will do to you for stealing</p>
  <p>What the Devil? He's on another level</p>
  <p>It's a word! No, a name! MF - the Super-Villain!</p>
